# boarbar
The Django code for the website www.boar.bar

### What is this project about?
It is all about the Bavarian language, to preserve and teach it.
For this we want to create a standard, so we are able to communicate properly through writing.

### Why did you start this project?
The Bavarian Language is slowly being replaced by German. The reasons for that are immigrants, media and education majorly in German and because there is no standard for Bavarian.
I want to change that, I want that Bavarian speakers sit down and discuss the most logical way of writing their native language.

### Why did you choose "boar.bar"?
In Bavarian a "Boar" is somebody from Bavaria or a Bavarian speaker. "bar" is the ISO 639-3 code for the Bavarian language.

### So you don't agree with people who did something similar before?
No. There are 3 different groups of people who write Bavarian, those who never wrote Bavarian before and just write as they think is right (which for the most part is a heavily Germanified Bavarian), those who sat down and thought about it, but stuck with historical writing and then there is the small group of people who are overly zealous and write so the written Bavarian resembles the spoken one as close as possible (through millions of letters).
The Standard we are creating is between the last two. The thought process for this standard is to make it as logical, but also as simple as possible, while not sacrificing any of the "color" Bavarian has. We don't consider historical reasons to be valid (for example we replaced the German "sch" / English "sh" with "š").
